This repository contains code meant to classifiy MNIST Handwritten Digits using Neural Networks. 

The keras deep learning libaray provides a convience method for downloading MNSIT DATASET.
This very handy for developing and testing models.

To demonstarate how easy it to load into database we can refer to offical documentation of Keras:https://keras.io/datasets/
